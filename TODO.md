- Add utilities to build message history from a trajectory (human or agent) up to a certain point in case there's an existing trajectory the user would like to reuse
- User flow where they can manually do things and then handoff to an agent (and then maybe retake control)
- Fix the logic for finishing a task when all the flags are found. It feels clunky now in a few ways (e.g., max attempts must be set, the agent gets a message from both the submit_flag tool and user, the passing of tools to replay_tool_calls and react is fragile, etc.)
- Don't have "you can do this message, keep going" message show when the agent correctly finds a flag.
- Fix the fact that files aren't actually created in solution script (i.e., usernames and passwords)
